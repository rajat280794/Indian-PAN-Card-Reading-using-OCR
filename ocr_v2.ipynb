    "gaussian noise from the image. On the contrary, gaussian blurring does not preserve the edges in the input.\n",

    "kernel. Particularly, this outperforms other blurring methods in removing salt-and-pepper noise in the images.\n",

    "Median blurring is a non-linear filter. Unlike linear filters, median blurring replaces the pixel values \n",
    "with the median value available in the neighborhood values. So, median blurring preserves edges \n",
    "as the median value must be the value of one of neighboring pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Speaking of keeping edges sharp, bilateral filtering is quite useful for removing the noise without \n",
    "smoothing the edges. Similar to gaussian blurring, bilateral filtering also uses a gaussian filter \n",
    "to find the gaussian weighted average in the neighborhood. However, it also takes pixel difference into \n",
    "account while blurring the nearby pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it ensures only those pixels with similar intensity to the central pixel are blurred, \n",
